 Q-How to get latitude and longitude coordinates? 
 Get the coordinates of a place you find on the map with your browser, like Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer.

3.Select What's here?
4.Under the search box, an info card with coordinates will appear.

 Q-Why isn't the email address showing up in the listings? 
 The email address is not showing up because it is being programmatically blocked.
 The reason for this is to protect the privacy of your users so that their email address does not appear for public viewing where email harvesting bots can grab them and add them to spam email lists.
